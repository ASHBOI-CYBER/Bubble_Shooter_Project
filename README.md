# Bubble_Shooter_Project
Bubble Shooter is a classic puzzle game where players aim to match three or more bubbles of the same color to pop them and clear the board. This version of the game is built using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for rendering graphics and handling user input.
